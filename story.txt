Once upon a time, there was a young boy named John who lives in Alaska.
John lives in an igloo and eats fish that he catches everyday.
Someday John wishes to find his one true love.

And one day, that opportunity came. He caught a magical fish, one that 
could talk. It begged John not to eat him, promising anything John wanted. 
John agreed, and sat down to think about what he wanted.

John looked at the fish with intense eyes, and started talking about how he always wanted to find
love, but he realizes now that he could be granted anything. So, he asked for endless burritos.

John ate the burritos day after day after day. Eventually he became so sick of burritos that he moved away from Alaska.

John moved to Jamaica and met a lovely lady.
John married this lady and he lived a happy rest of his life.
The end.
