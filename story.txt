Once upon a time, there was a young boy named John who lives in Alaska.
John lives in an igloo and eats fish that he catches everyday.
Someday John wishes to find his one true love.

And one day, that opportunity came. He caught a magical fish, one that could talk. It begged John not to eat him, promising anything John wanted. John agreed, and sat down to think about what he wanted.
